            <p class="paregh"> Welcome to Learn HTML, the easiest way to learn HTML & CSS online, interactively.

                Learning HTML & CSS is essential for any web developer, and does not require to know how to program
                using JavaScript.

                Before you begin, I would recommend that you start out by downloading an HTML & CSS IDE. My personal
                preference is to use an IDE by JetBrains. You can download the PyCharm Community Edition for free, which
                has really good HTML, CSS and JavaScript development support built-in, along with all the goodies that a
                good IDE provides - source code integration, code refactoring, automatic indentation, syntax
                highlighting, comparison tool, etc.
                HTML for Absolute Beginners
                While many guides on the internet attempt to teach HTML using a lot of mind-boggling theory, this
                tutorial will instead focus on giving you the practical skills to build your first site.

                The aim is to show you ‘how’ to create your first web page without spending the entire tutorial focusing
                too much on the “why.”

                By the end of this tutorial, you will have the know-how to create a basic website and we hope that this
                will inspire you to delve further into the world of HTML using our follow-on guides.

                What is HTML?
                Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know
                what you are writing.

                HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them
                functional.

                The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later
                tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.

                The History of HTML
                HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for
                Hyper Text Markup Language.

                Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the
                document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.

                A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and
                presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.

                What are Tags and Attributes?
                Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.

                They work together but perform different functions – it is worth investing 2 minutes in differentiating
                the two.
